# Computer-Vision-Control


Controlling the motors of a quadcopter through a nested PID hub that receives instructions from a microprocessor after intricate video processing via the use of neural networks for object detection. This contains the necessary code for camera calibration and then finding real world coordinates from pixel coordinates to find the distance from just a single camera lens. Based on the information from the neural network, the PID controller then drives the quadcopter in any specific direction. The ground basics are here and the playground is open.
